A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their
hands, and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them many good things of
what there was in the house, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side, and
a man-servant brought them wine and poured it out for them.

Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their
hands, maids went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and they laid their hands
upon the good things that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted music and dancing,
which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce to
sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers
that no man might hear.

>"I hope, sir," said he, "that you will not be offended with what I am going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not
pay for it, and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding to powder in the
surf.

If these men were to see my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for
longer legs rather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even
when people do sometimes say that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now, sir, tell me
and tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in,
how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by land.
Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my father's time? In the
old days we had many visitors for my father went about much himself."
